# Project Showcase: Quiz Application
I'm excited to introduce my latest project, a simple yet engaging Quiz Application built using Python and Tkinter GUI library. 
This project aims to provide users with an interactive way to test their knowledge while enjoying a seamless user experience.

## Overview
The Quiz Application offers the following key features:

Dynamic Question Fetching: Questions are fetched from an online API, ensuring a diverse and constantly updated pool of questions for users to answer.

User-friendly Interface: The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with responsive buttons and clear score display.

Immediate Feedback: Users receive immediate feedback on their answers, with visual cues indicating whether their response was correct or incorrect.

Score Tracking: The application tracks users' scores throughout the quiz session, allowing them to see their progress in real-time.

## Why This Project?
I developed this project with the goal of creating a fun and educational experience for users of all ages. By leveraging the power of Python and Tkinter, I was able to create a smooth and enjoyable quiz experience that can be easily accessed by anyone with a Python environment.

## How to Use
Using the Quiz Application is simple:

* Run the main script to start the quiz.
* Answer the True/False questions displayed on the interface by clicking the corresponding buttons.
* Receive immediate feedback on your answers and track your score as you progress through the quiz.
* Once all questions are answered, the final score will be displayed.
