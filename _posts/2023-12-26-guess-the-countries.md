# Guess the 50 States Game
This Python script utilizes the Turtle graphics library and pandas to create an interactive game called "Guess the 50 States." The game displays a map of the United States, and the user is prompted to guess the names of each state. The user can exit the game at any time, and the script will save the remaining states to a CSV file for further learning.

## Gameplay
The game displays a map of the United States with state borders and names hidden.
The user is prompted to guess the names of the states by entering them through the input dialog.
Typing "Exit" at any time allows the user to exit the game.
After exiting, the script saves the remaining states to a CSV file named "States_to_learn.csv."
