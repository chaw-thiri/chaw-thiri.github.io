lead: Data Analysis using Python, Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib and Seaborn

🔍

Analyzed the major and minor modes' influence on stream count.
Explored correlations between BPM, danceability, and stream counts.
Leveraged Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

For the dataset, I refereneced it from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023).
# 📈 Results:
* No relation exists between danceablity % and total number of streams.
* The most popular songs this year are released on 2022,2021 and 2020 in descending order.
* No relation exists between bpm and the total number of streams.
* Major mode is streamed more than the minor mode. (Major mode sounds bright, happy, and stable, with a specific pattern of intervals. Minor mode evokes a darker, sadder, and more reflective mood, with a distinct interval pattern.)
# Features
Uncovered fascinating insights into how musical elements impact streaming popularity.
Visualized trends through interactive Jupyter notebooks.
