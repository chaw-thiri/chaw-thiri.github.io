# What is UDP?
A UDP (User Datagram Protocol) server using sockets is a program that listens for incoming UDP packets on a specified port and performs actions based on the data received. Unlike TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP is a connectionless protocol that does not establish a persistent connection between the sender and receiver. Instead, it sends individual packets of data, called datagrams, independently.
