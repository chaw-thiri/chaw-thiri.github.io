lead: very simple student record system which uses OOP and file reading 
---
This simple Python script provides a basic Student Record Management System. It utilizes a custom file format for storing student records, allowing users to print existing records, add new students, and exit the program. The script uses classes (StudentFileReader, StudentFileWriter, StudentRecord) to handle file operations and represent student records.
